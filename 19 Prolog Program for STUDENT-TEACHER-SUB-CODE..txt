% Rules to query the database

% Query subjects taught by a specific teacher
find_subjects_by_teacher(Teacher, Subject, SubjectCode) :-
    teaches(Teacher, Subject, SubjectCode).

% Query teachers of a specific subject
find_teacher_by_subject(Subject, Teacher, SubjectCode) :-
    teaches(Teacher, Subject, SubjectCode).

% Query subjects taken by a specific student
find_subjects_by_student(Student, Subject) :-
    student(Student, Subject).

% Query students taking a specific subject
find_students_by_subject(Subject, Student) :-
    student(Student, Subject).

% Query subjects and their codes taken by a specific student
find_subjects_codes_by_student(Student, Subject, SubjectCode) :-
    student(Student, Subject),
    teaches(_, Subject, SubjectCode).

% Sample queries
% To find subjects taught by Mrs. Smith: find_subjects_by_teacher('Mrs. Smith', Subject, SubjectCode).

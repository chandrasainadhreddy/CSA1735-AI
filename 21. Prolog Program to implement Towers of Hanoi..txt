% Towers of Hanoi
% hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary, Moves) - Moves is the list of moves required to move N disks from Source to Target using Auxiliary.

% Base case: No disks to move
hanoi(0, _, _, _, []).

% Recursive case: Move N disks
hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary, Moves) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    hanoi(N1, Source, Auxiliary, Target, Moves1),       % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary using Target as auxiliary
    MoveDisk = move(Source, Target),                    % Move the Nth disk from Source to Target
    hanoi(N1, Auxiliary, Target, Source, Moves2),       % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Target using Source as auxiliary
    append(Moves1, [MoveDisk|Moves2], Moves).           % Combine the moves
